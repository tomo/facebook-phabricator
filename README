WHAT IS PHABRICATOR?

Phabricator is a suite of web applications that facilitate software development
tasks, particularly code review. The primary application in the suite is
Differential, a code review tool.

Phabricator is highly unstable and has many missing features! These applications
are being brought over from Facebook's internal toolset, but there's a lot of
stuff that hasn't made it over yet. Feel free to follow the project but you
probably shouldn't try to install this yet unless you're extremely ambitious
or just want to take a look at it.
