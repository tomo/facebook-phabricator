This is not a complete list of changes, just of API or workflow changes that may
break existing installs. Newer changes are listed at the top. If you pull new
changes and things stop working, check here first!

May 11 2011 - New session code
  There's some new code which allows you to establish multiple web sessions.
  When you update to it, all users will be logged out. This is expected, just
  log in again and everything should work properly.

May 10 2011 - PhabricatorMailImplementationAdapter
  The signatures of setFrom() and addReplyTo() have changed, and they now
  accept a second "$name = ''" parameter. This represents a human-readable
  name component of the address.

May 9 2011 - git submodule
  As of commit 2a39fd0, you must run "git submodule update --init" in your
  clone. This was added to the install documentation in commit 09b498c, see that
  commit for details.
